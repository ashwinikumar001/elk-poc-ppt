### Pendings and To Be Decided

1.  Log-format/facilities/severities of the different logs
		--  Browser sending logs
		--  Server side logs
		--  Containers peripheral logs
		--  Haproxy logs
2.  Should we have a unique id with every api requests in the request scope
3.  How does the browser send it's logs
		--  To haproxy / Logstash
		--  Using TCP/HTTP
4.  Should we make the code checkout and port/db configuration as part of the dockerfile/shell script for automation
		-- configure to take the git update by itself always production or from env variable
        -- configure the data source to read from the environment variable
        -- configure the .hotelsoftrc to automatically point to the correct database schema 
5.  Email notification for the critical errors in the prod-rzr-app.

### Hawkular in brief

1. [Hawkular](http://www.hawkular.org/index.html)
2. [Hawkular Demo](http://192.168.59.103:8080/)
3. [Currently not supported with NodeJS](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-300)

### Next Steps

1. Implement the log-formats
2. Automate the rzr-app deployment/configuration
3. Configure Logstash/Kibana to better format our custom messages and show the events in a better visual ways.
4. Investigate Hawkular more to make it suit the razor application, If needed
